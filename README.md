## ***Why this subject:***

It was chosen by the relevance of video games today. More than 75% of young people up to 40 years old are considered gamers. This industry is much larger and raises more money than film and music combined.

As a young video game company, the possibility of launching the first video game on the world's largest PC platform, Steam, is being evaluated due to its relevance and reach of more than 130 million monthly active players.

#### 1. ***Hypothesis raised:***

Taking into account the rise of video games and their relevance, we seek to study data from the Steam platform to evaluate the following:

- Is the Steam video game platform a good sales place for video games?

- Are AAA Video Games More Popular Than Indies?

- The video game market on Steam is very competitive, especially for Indies?

#### 2. ***Curiosity:***

There is a concept called Shovelgames, which was unknown to us. It refers to those games created in short periods, with low quality, and published massively to catch some sales. A clear example is a developer called: William at Oxford, which published more than 50 games in 3 years. The problem is so big that Steam, in recent years, Steam has removed thousands of games to "try" to solve this problem.

#### 3. ***Conclusions:***

- The Steam video game platform is a good place for sales. However, they do not have any filter when accepting video games for sale, which generates visibility problems, especially for small creators.

- AAA video games are more popular than Indie games, although not by a wide margin.

- The market of video games on Steam is very competitive, both for Indies and AAA. Due to Shovelgames.

#### 4. ***Recommendations:***

- Carry out a marketing campaign with a defined target to stand out from the Shovelgames.

- Focus on popular genres, such as casual, action, and adventure, as they are more attractive to the market.

- Seek access to other more exclusive platforms as the Nintendo store, for greater visibility and potential market.
